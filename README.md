# Small Steps

#### _An Android app focusing on habit building through small steps, Current Version: 05-26-2017_

#### By _**John Carr**_

## Description
Small Steps is an Android App that aims to help you build habits by focusing on small steps. It is based on the ideas of The 3 R’s of Habit Change: Reminder, Routine, and Reward:

* A Reminder is the trigger that initiates the behavior.
* A Routine is the behavior, itself.
* A Reward is the benefit gained from performing the behavior.

This app uses Reminders to trigger Routines to earn Rewards. With this process, small steps build big habits!
